#PATHWAYS 
IS AN INTERACTIVE LEARNING SOLUTION THAT STORES PROCEEDURES, CURRENTLY, IN SESSION STORAGE AND UTILIZES INDEXEDDB TO HOLD THE PATHWAY INFORMATION.
IT CAN BE UTILIZED TO LEARN PROCEEDURES AND DOESN'T REQUIRE A DATABASE OTHER THAN THE INDEXEDDB API IN ALL BROWSERS.
THERE ARE LIMITATIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IT CAN STORE AT THE MOMENT BUT IT SHOULD BE USEFUL TO LEARN HOW TO COMPLETE TASKS, LEARN PROCEEDURE, 
LEARN WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY, OR EVEN ENTICE YOUR CHILD TO READ BY THE WRITING OF A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE BOOK WITH PICTURES. ONE WOULD HOPE THAT
YOU CAN ALSO GET YOUR CHILDREN TO WRITE THEMSELVES.
THERE ARE OTHER VERSIONS IN THE WORKS. THE INFORMATION IS PURIFIED AND THERE IS NO CODE THAT TALKS TO ANY OTHER COMPUTER. I WILL NEVER PLACE ANY CODE THAT 
CONTACTS ANOTHER SYSTEM INSIDE THIS HTML PAGE. IT IS MEANT TO BE PRIVATE IN THAT REGARD.
FUTURE VERSIONS THAT DO THIS IN A FORM OF DATABASES WILL BE IN A SEPERATE REPOSITORY. THIS VERSION IS FOR THE PUBLIC.
ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER MAY AT THIS TIME UP TO 12. IT IS NOT AN INDICATION OF THE VERSION NUMBER, JUST A FOLDER NUMBER BUT CHOOSE THE HIGHEST ONE. IT SHOULD BE FUNCTIONAL AT THIS POINT.
THERE IS A SYSTEM TO CONFIGURE IT AND VIEW IT AS WELL.
BE AWARE THE INFORMATION IS STORED ON THE BROWSER SO IT CAN BE SOURCED FROM YOUR COMPUTER BUT WILL NOT CONTACT ANY OTHER COMPUTER TO GIVE OUT INFORMAITON.
THE MENU SYSTEM ONLY HAS THE LIMITATIONS OF THE BROWSER AS DOES THE OBJECT AT THIS TIME. SESSION STORAGE ONLY HOLDS FIVE MBS.
FUTURE VERSIONS WILL NOT HAVE THE SESSION STORAGE LIMITATION.
ENJOY...
PLEASE TAKE CARE TO MONITOR YOUR CHILDRENS ACTIVITES AND LEARNING.
THE SYSTEM CAN BE INSTALLED ON A WAMP SERVER OR OTHER WEB SERVER DEVISED FOR LOCALHOST USAGE BUT OTHERWISE WILL NOT FUNCTION.
## FINAL VERSION
FULLY OPERATIONAL. CHANGES LINKS WHEN COPYING SEGMENTS AND MODULES, ALLOWS EXPORT INTO JSON CODE TO BE COPIED TO TEXT FILES WHICH ALLOWS FILLING THE SYSTEM, 
FULLY WORKING. READ THE BELOW.

PATHWAYS
INTRODUCTION
Pathways is an interactive learning solution based on events and choices utilized through multiple choice questions in order to teach and reinforce proceedural knowledge.

Students can create their own senareos to share with others in order to reinforce their knowledge of proceedure as well as give this information to thier organizations or institutions to share with the rest of the class. This allows some of the workload to be taken off the individual.

Along with multiple choices that lead to multiple results there are answers why you should and should not have chosen that result given the training provided. It is advised that the student fills this informaiton in the feild but it isn't necessary and won't show if the field is left empty. It is also advised that this content is read in order to promote repetition of learning and the cementation of knowledge.

A menu system is provided on the top right corner of the page where you can create training and find a section to open modules and copy the text. You can also paste this information within the section provided to copy others learning material or share your own. Please be aware that this information is stored on the browser and caution should be taken in regards to this information if the information is confidential. Regardless, if so, the information can be uploaded and removed at will otherwise consider running a browser that runs on a usb stick or something for security purposes. The information should not readily be accessable by anyone who opens the browser as it requires the website to be shown. That said it must be known that this website doesn't encrypt any data.

You can copy segments, which copies from within the segment, not inclusive of the selected segment. Alternatively you can copy individual segments via retrieve information inclusive of the selected item. However, you must input the information with the input information page.

You can now copy modules without having to redo the links. You can also copy segments and whole modules without redoing links, however; when copying copying multiple modules you cannot copy the links unless you delete all modules within your system before inserting a group of modules. This is due to it being dificult to transfer multiple modules locations where the previous position was. Steps will be made to rectify this in the future for public versions.

The copy segment button can be used to copy the entire module page but does have limitations. Sorry... The current version has limitations associated with the browser in relation to the time it takes to copy in a loop and in relation to the amount of data held in session storage. This limitation is capable of copying a fairly large number of segments however and shouldn't really limit your ability for training. Unfortunately choose your own adventure books may not be an option if they're too long. If this happens, you simply won't see the item appear. Again sorry... There's not really much I can do at this time about that.

There is also functionallity for linking segments to other segments to start at a previous or future position in order to restart certain pathways if one should need to undo steps. This link allows you to not have to rewrite training material please fill in the link field if you utilize this option as this will be the information shown instead of the usual. It links to the previous section and displays that information with the options of the current section. You can also delete all links from a segment.

You can display pictures for a number of seconds before or if wanted display a picture in the selection process for as long as you haven't selected an option. This is beneficial for such people as emergency services and should be utilized to test quick response to situations such as fire fighting, medical proceedures, or otherwise.

The system colour codes the menu as well. Green for correct pathways, red for wrong pathways, yellow for links, and orange for deleted links. The colours can be changed to correct if needed. Otherwise yellow will automatically be added whenever a link is created and unchecking correct will turn it red.

To save the information this webpage utilizes an api called indexedDB.

You can make as many multiple choice quesitons dependent on your needs. Each level will allow for multiple choices within choices. Try to keep it entertaining for other students or workers as this will keep you and others engaged and increase the pace of learning as well as keep you and others motivated to continue.

Please ensure you read the reasons associated as to why choices either were good or bad in relation to the path you chose while choosing your path or after you have completed your path. The repetition helps to maintain memory for a longer duration regardless of knowing the knowledge.

It also makes for a wicked word game or choose your own adventure system.

Enjoy your training.
