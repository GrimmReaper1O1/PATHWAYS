#PATHWAYS 
IS AN INTERACTIVE LEARNING SOLUTION THAT STORES PROCEEDURES, CURRENTLY, IN SESSION STORAGE AND UTILIZES INDEXEDDB TO HOLD THE PATHWAY INFORMATION.
IT CAN BE UTILIZED TO LEARN PROCEEDURES AND DOESN'T REQUIRE A DATABASE OTHER THAN THE INDEXEDDB API IN ALL BROWSERS.
THERE ARE LIMITATIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IT CAN STORE AT THE MOMENT BUT IT SHOULD BE USEFUL TO LEARN HOW TO COMPLETE TASKS, LEARN PROCEEDURE, 
LEARN WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY, OR EVEN ENTICE YOUR CHILD TO READ BY THE WRITING OF A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE BOOK WITH PICTURES. ONE WOULD HOPE THAT
YOU CAN ALSO GET YOUR CHILDREN TO WRITE THEMSELVES.
THERE ARE OTHER VERSIONS IN THE WORKS. THE INFORMATION IS PURIFIED AND THERE IS NO CODE THAT TALKS TO ANY OTHER COMPUTER. I WILL NEVER PLACE ANY CODE THAT 
CONTACTS ANOTHER SYSTEM INSIDE THIS HTML PAGE. IT IS MEANT TO BE PRIVATE IN THAT REGARD.
FUTURE VERSIONS THAT DO THIS IN A FORM OF DATABASES WILL BE IN A SEPERATE REPOSITORY. THIS VERSION IS FOR THE PUBLIC.
ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER MAY AT THIS TIME UP TO 12. IT IS NOT AN INDICATION OF THE VERSION NUMBER, JUST A FOLDER NUMBER BUT CHOOSE THE HIGHEST ONE. IT SHOULD BE FUNCTIONAL AT THIS POINT.
THERE IS A SYSTEM TO CONFIGURE IT AND VIEW IT AS WELL.
BE AWARE THE INFORMATION IS STORED ON THE BROWSER SO IT CAN BE SOURCED FROM YOUR COMPUTER BUT WILL NOT CONTACT ANY OTHER COMPUTER TO GIVE OUT INFORMAITON.
THE MENU SYSTEM ONLY HAS THE LIMITATIONS OF THE BROWSER AS DOES THE OBJECT AT THIS TIME. SESSION STORAGE ONLY HOLDS FIVE MBS.
FUTURE VERSIONS WILL NOT HAVE THE SESSION STORAGE LIMITATION.
ENJOY...
PLEASE TAKE CARE TO MONITOR YOUR CHILDRENS ACTIVITES AND LEARNING.
THE SYSTEM CAN BE INSTALLED ON A WAMP SERVER OR OTHER WEB SERVER DEVISED FOR LOCALHOST USAGE BUT OTHERWISE WILL NOT FUNCTION.
## VERSION 1.1 
The system is now completely functional but is somewhat ugly as hell. Otherwise it works but is only capable of storing 5mb due to session storage limitations. That said
the object is capable of storing a pathway system the size of war and piece. Roughly 1000 pages. It is advised the system is utilized one huge work at a time. That said
it will store many small word games or many small modules. For training purposes this should be just fine. 
You will however need to copy any images to the image folder before entering the image file name in the alter settings field.
