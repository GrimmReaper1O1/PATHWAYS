                <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
                <p>Pathways is an interactive learning solution based on events and choices
                    utilized through multiple choice questions in order to teach and reinforce 
                    proceedural knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>Students can create their own senareos to share with others in order to 
                    reinforce their knowledge of proceedure as well as give this information 
                    to thier organizations or institutions to share with the rest of the class.
                    This allows some of the workload to be taken off the individual.
                </p>
                <p>Along with multiple choices that lead to multiple results there are answers
                    why you should and should not have chosen that result given the training 
                    provided. It is advised that the student fills this informaiton in the feild 
                    but it isn't necessary and won't show if the field is left empty. It is also 
                    advised that this content is read in order to promote repetition of learning 
                    and the cementation of knowledge.

                <p>You can make one to ten multiple choices dependent on your needs. Each level will 
                    allow for multiple choices within choices. Try to keep it entertaining for other 
                    students or workers as this will keep you and others engaged and increase the pace
                    of learning as well as keep you and others motivated to continue.

                    the reasons associated as to why choices either were good or bad in relation to the 
                    path you chose while choosing your path or after you have completed your path. The 
                    repetition helps to maintain memory for a longer duration regardless of knowing the 
                    knowledge.
