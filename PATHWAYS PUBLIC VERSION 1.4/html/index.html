                <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
                <p>Pathways is an interactive learning solution based on events and choices
                    utilized through multiple choice questions in order to teach and reinforce 
                    proceedural knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>Students can create their own senareos to share with others in order to 
                    reinforce their knowledge of proceedure as well as give this information 
                    to thier organizations or institutions to share with the rest of the class.
                    This allows some of the workload to be taken off the individual.
                </p>
                <p>Along with multiple choices that lead to multiple results there are answers
                    why you should and should not have chosen that result given the training 
                    provided. It is advised that the student fills this informaiton in the feild 
                    but it isn't necessary and won't show if the field is left empty. It is also 
                    advised that this content is read in order to promote repetition of learning 
                    and the cementation of knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>A menu system is provided on the top right corner of the page where you can 
                    create training and find a section to open modules and copy the text. You can 
                    also paste this information within the section provided to copy others learning 
                    material or share your own. Please be aware that this information is stored on 
                    the browser and caution should be taken in regards to this information if the 
                    information is confidential. Regardless, if so, the information can be uploaded 
                    and removed at will otherwise consider running a browser that runs on a usb stick
                    or something for security purposes. The information should not readily be accessable
                    by anyone who opens the browser as it requires the website to be shown. That said it
                    must be known that this website doesn't encrypt any data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can copy segments, which copies from within the segment, not inclusive of the selected segment.
                    Alternatively you can copy individual segments via retrieve information inclusive of the selected item.
                    However, you must input the information with the input information page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can now copy modules without having to redo the links, however; when copying segments within modules
                    the system cannot copy links. This is due to it being dificult to know where the previous position was. 
                    Steps will be made to rectify this in the future for public versions. That said if you are copying individual
                    pieces and not entire modules, you are likely building modules and you can redo the links.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The copy segment button can be used to copy the entire module page but does have limitations. Sorry... 
                    The current version has limitations associated with the browser in relation to the time it takes to 
                    copy in a loop and in relation to the amount of data held in session storage. This limitation is capable
                    of copying a fairly large number of segments however and shouldn't really limit your ability for training.
                    Unfortunately choose your own adventure books may not be an option if they're too long. If this happens, 
                    you simply won't see the item appear. Again sorry... There's not really much I can do at this time about 
                    that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also functionallity for linking segments to other segments to start at a 
                    previous or future position in order to restart certain pathways if one should need 
                    to undo steps. This link allows you to not have to rewrite training material please
                    fill in the link field if you utilize this option as this will be the information shown 
                    instead of the usual. It links to the previous section and displays that information
                    with the options of the current section. You can also delete all links from a segment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can display pictures for a number of seconds before or if wanted display a picture 
                    in the selection process for as long as you haven't selected an option. This is beneficial 
                    for such people as emergency services and should be utilized to test quick response to 
                    situations such as fire fighting, medical proceedures, or otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system colour codes the menu as well. Green for correct pathways, red for wrong pathways, 
                    yellow for links, and orange for deleted links. The colours can be changed to correct if needed.
                    Otherwise yellow will automatically be added whenever a link is created and unchecking correct 
                    will turn it red.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To save the information this webpage utilizes an api called indexedDB.
                </p>
                <p>You can make as many multiple choice quesitons dependent on your needs. Each level will 
                    allow for multiple choices within choices. Try to keep it entertaining for other 
                    students or workers as this will keep you and others engaged and increase the pace
                    of learning as well as keep you and others motivated to continue. 
                </p>
                <p>Please ensure you read 
                    the reasons associated as to why choices either were good or bad in relation to the 
                    path you chose while choosing your path or after you have completed your path. The 
                    repetition helps to maintain memory for a longer duration regardless of knowing the 
                    knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also makes for a wicked word game or choose your own adventure system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enjoy your training.
